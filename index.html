    <a href="https://www.bears.com/"><img src="img/bear.jpg" alt="A bear waving, as if saying 'Hello!'.
         The picture also links to a website called 'Bears.com' (url: 'bears.com'), which is almost reasonable 
         in the context of this site, but Bears.com is itself a very strange site for a few different 
         but unrelated reasons. I am in no way affiliated with Bears.com."></a>
